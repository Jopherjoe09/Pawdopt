              Adoption Benefits
            </span>
            <br>Each year, millions of pets are available through animal shelters around the world. Even though their previous owners may have had troubles or unrealistic expectations about owning a pet, these dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens will make a great addition to your family. And, through careful examinations and staff efforts, animals at the Pet Adoption Center are chosen to be the best match for you
          </p>
          <p>
            Staff makes every effort possible to collect a complete history of the animal, to treat medical issues and to assess temperament, so that these pets can make a smooth transition into your home</p>
            <p>In addition to offering pets that are a good match for you, shelters also provide counseling or additional assistance on the parenting of your pet and are often less expensive than other animal facilities.</p>
